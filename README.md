## DESCRIPTION

There're 2 main javascript files handling UI interactions
- " `**application/assets/js/gamePlay.js**` " : contains the game logic and starts the game too
- " `**application/assets/js/gameBoard.js**` " : contains the DOM manipulation functions

## GAME FLOW
- initially, when the games loads,**Game** controller loads the game and the past scores (from the database)
- when the game is loaded, the user can then play and all of the interactions is handled by Javascript
- after the game is finished (all 9 squares clicked, or there's a clear winner), the user has to click **SAVE TO DATABSE** so that the result can be stored into an SQL databse
- this saving into the database is once more handled by the **Game** controller. But first there's a javascript function "**filleScoresForm**" which collects the winner and user names and stores in a hidden form in the DOM. If it's a draw, it also adds it into the hidden form. So when user clicks on "save the score to database", PHP submis this form in the background into the Database
